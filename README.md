# Simple-SharePoint-Metrics

We can use SharePoint Search, to provide a simple metrics overview about the usage of our site and content. This sample will show the steps.

First create a new library named "Scripts" in the site collection that should be used. Copy the content of the folder "Header Scripts" of this repository to this new library.

Upload the js-files from the folder "Display Templates" to folder "Display Templates/Search" in the Masterpage gallery. You can upload them directly to this folder or you can create a separate subfolder (I prefer using a subfolder). After the upload, set the metadata for each of the js-files.
